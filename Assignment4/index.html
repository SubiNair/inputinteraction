<h2>On van Gogh and Loving Vincent</h2>
<p>
Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch artist who is perhaps most famous for his self portrait and Starry Night. He died by gunshot wound in 1890 during his stay in France.
</p>

<p>
	The details of the events after he passed are presented in the animated film, Loving Vincent. The film is most notable for the animation technique, where each of the frames was an oil painting on canvas using the same techniques that van Gogh used. The film had actors who acted out the scenes in front of green screens, which were then covered with paint by 125 painters from all over the world. Loving Vincent was a Polish production.
</p>
	
<p>
	The film follows Armand Roulin, the son of Vincent's postman as he attempts to deliver Vincent's last letter to his brother. As the film progresses, he interacts with many people from van Gogh's life and we the audience learn about him and the impact he had on people despite the fact he was a relatively unknown artist while he was alive.
</p>

<p>
	The film is not necessarily a traditional biographical feature. You aren't experiencing van Gogh's life through van Gogh. Instead you are learning from the people closest to him, such as the inkeeper's daughter from the inn he lived in, or his doctor. The focus is not on the painter but on the man, who he was besides his profession and ultimately his deterioration. However the film ends on a positive note, where Armand Roulin returns home having learned much more about Vincent as a person and what he meant to people.
